Changes/Additions:

Added a flashlight above lemons head that points to the nearest enemy. This function utilized both the dot product and  linear interpolation(smooth roation) - this part was done by Issac Perkins

Added a trigger to the bathroom such that when you go in, the showering ghost "Poofs" away. This trigger toggles a sound effect and uses the unity particle system - This Addition was done by Hunter McMahon

Added a trigger to the gargoyles that shoots flames when the player is in range and stops when the player is out of range. The trigger radius is slightly larger than the GameEnding radius, so the flame acts more as a warning to the player - this part done by Juan Rios

To be frank, not many online wenpages or videos lined up well to what we wanted to accomplish. In turn we did turn to Chat GPT to assist. This mainly came in the form of prompts asking things along the line of "how do i do so and so in unity". Although our implementations were based on these responses, the code was still "handwritten" by us and the AI generated content was moreso used as reference material.
