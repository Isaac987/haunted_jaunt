Sources:
To be frank, not many online wenpages or videos lined up well to what we wanted to accomplish. In turn we did turn to Chat GPT to assist. This mainly came in the form of prompts asking things along the line of "how do i do so and so in unity". Although our implementations were based on these responses, the code was still "handwritten" by us and the AI generated content was moreso used as reference material.
